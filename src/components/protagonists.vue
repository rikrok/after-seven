            Good does exist in this world, but it is demonized and foriegn to many people. The following are allies, concepts or groups of people that won't go out of their way to harm your character.

                    Most of the members of the civilized world are enslaved by the various governments. It is not apparent to many of the people who work and live for their masters. 
                    Shopkeepers, bakers, artisans and infantry are all willing slaves to some sort of governmental system. The very notation of freedom is very alien to these people.

                    There are few know they are slaves in a system designed to oppress and serve morally bankrupt masters. These people live their lives in fear, for 
                    if they are discovered their fate worsens. They become criminals and shipped out to serve life-long tasks of dangerous or tedious labor. They cling
                    onto hope that someday, somehow, it will be better.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, these are the few that escape to become wild mortals.

                    The word savage is a term that is too harsh for this bunch. They are self-independent farmers, hunters and survivors. They are refugees that escaped
                    civilization to live out in the wild. They dodge monsters, hide from the avatar spawn and subvert the secret police that roam the country side.

                    The Legion are reformed Enforcers, Slaves, or Nobles who seek to change the world as they know it. They see it for what it is: awful. The Legion is not
                    unified nor centralized. It is just a branding of 'Wild Mortals' who willingly oppose and sabotage the systems they once served. The Legion is well
                    known by the nobles, and are actively hunted and pursued by the noble's enforcers. If there is anything that could unify the six governments, it is 
                    a joint effort to destroy a Legion camp.
