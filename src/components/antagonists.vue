                    Each of the six remaining 'governments' have a class of nobility. These nobles are corrupt and powerful individuals that rule over entire populations in a geographical area. 
                    A noble's authority is never questioned or really thought about. It just is. Those seeking shelter from the dangers of the world bend their knee to the nobles and are grateful 
                    of the protection and shelter they provide. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nobles take advantage of this by solidifying their power over the peasantry through a never-ending quest to satisfy their power-hungry ambitions.

                    Those that serve the nobility's will is known as an enforcer. They are loyal to only one noble, or noble house. They are given power and freedom in how to accomplish their masterâ€™s will. The 
                    "ends to a mean" are dark, awful and twisted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enforcers take form of Military Generals, mid-level officers of the government, Chief of Police or secret police agents. They are embedded into the system and use the system against their 
                    opponents.

                    There are those that roam the lands without a master other than themselves. They are merchants, bartering between factions. They are ever sly, untrustworthy and mischievous. These rogues 
                    will gladly sell out other people to get ahead in life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are rare but when encountered they live up to their reputation as very deadly and untrustworthy individuals. They often sell out refugees to enforcers or the nobility, but always 
                    with the question of "when" or "how" as they are devious planners and masters of manipulation.

                    Avatars are powerful creatures that have supreme power, intellect and presence. They want to rule the world and enslave all mortals. They will cause terrible wars for this purpose. 
                    <Strong> Luckily </Strong> After the seventh apocalypse, this caused these titan-like beings to slumber after a humiliating defeat which freed all mortals from their slavery. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They still sing songs to mortals, giving their power in return for prayers and meditations. This is the source of all Divine magic.

                    Magical and mythic beasts stalk the wilds, finding all mortals to be prey. These are beasts, unwilling to be tamed and a sight to behold. Examples include dire spiders, hydras and
                    dinosaur-like creatures.

                    Avatars have spawned countless variations of humans. These include (but are not limited to) Goblins, Kobolds, Gnolls and Orcs. These creatures are semi-intelligent, but have an instinct
                    to destroy mortal civilization. They are not organized into governments or anything really comparable as to culture or society. They all worship some Avatar though (be it dead or living), 
                    and as such, will strike at mortals randomly and violently.

                    There are pockets of land which have earned the name 'deadlands'. These are pockets of land that which no mortal can inhabit. These lands not only have toxic earth, air and rivers but they are also home to 
                    copious amounts of inhospitable beasts, demons and various creatures who are supernatural in origin. These creatures wish to slay any mortal that treads these lands.
