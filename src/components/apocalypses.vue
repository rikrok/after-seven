        <h1> <strong> The Seven Apocalypses </strong> </h1>
        <p> 
            With each Apocalypse that came, the further Earth got away from the reality of modern day. Each event caused a thinning of civilization and what it meant to be "human". Some apocalypses only lasted
            a generation, while others spanning many.

                            In space, a monster appeared. A cloud of living debris covered the atmosphere of Earth. Satellite communication ceased and man made space objects were disabled or destroyed. Nations sent aircraft and missiles to engage the cloud creature – but all attempts ended in military defeat. The cloud continued to hug Earth, causing an endless night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suddenly, the creature solidified into a colossal and endless ball of tendrils. Tendrils slapped the Earth from space, causing canyons and much destruction on a global scale. When tendrils touched the ground, smaller tendril creatures spawned and crawled into humans, infecting them. Survivors became wizards and victims would implode into a mist of blood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The creature split into seven different creatures of nightmares. They started to glow a sickly blue. It then exploded into a column of lasers, carving hundreds of miles wide and long damage – flooding coastlines and creating rivers that imitate the Amazon’s size.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After their explosions, there was no more debris or nightmares. The Earth was left as a ruinous landscape with mourning and panicked millions. Not having sun wreaked havoc on global food supply. The global economic market collapsed. Pestilence, war and famine soon followed and destabilized civilization and world peace.

                        <p>
                            A generation after The Angry Sky events, humans changed. Over a span of a year, humans changed overnight or birthed elves of Fantasy, a primative form of human known as a Protohuman, or animal hybrids (Lycanthrope). This sudden and unexplainable spike of mutations caused several social political issues, which resulted in separations of established governments. World powers were no longer able to rule their people. 
                            Bloody civil wars constantly sprung up, slavery became a popular movement, and racism reigned against humans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Military combat was engaged at such a level that it depleted the remaining industrial capability of the world – leaving wizards to become more powerful as they were able to produce a means to victory. 
                            This shifted a world order favoring to a more tribal and feudal time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As traditional nations crumbled from the numerous civil wars, scientific growth was stunted. The scientific community was brutally dismantled and destroyed, as no government (new or old) could support such a community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Global trade also suffered from the civil wars. Many merchants could not maintain their supply chains. Governments abandoned their decaying or disarrayed infrastructure. Resources were unable to be extracted or refined at a scale that was once possible. This caused many unemployed and impoverished to the feudal lords for a serfdom contract of protection against raiders.

                        <p>
                            Overnight, terrible creatures were being discovered throughout the world. Creatures of legend appeared throughout the land with a blood lust. Mantis-Wasp like creatures infested lands by 100s of 
                            square miles overnight. Hovering eyeballs with dozens of tendrils roamed the lands. Rock creatures shock the earth. The dead walked the earth. The oceans spawned sea dragons and murderous mermaids. 
                            Elf, Lycanthrope, Protohumans, and Human alike were all targets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was soon discovered that they had masters. These masters were either titanic and colossal creatures or extremely powerful individuals, but known as an Avatar. 
                            Avatars had a purpose to destroy or enslave civilization as it was known. And with no significant or powerful military to defeat them, these Avatars soon enslaved much of civilization. Demanding tribute in 
                            slaves, gifts or other resources be given to them. In return, they would not destroy whomever was in that area or teach magic in return.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This lasted for generations, but because of Avatar territorial wars resulting in fewer Avatars, many mortals were able to free themselves from slavery. The cost of this era was that any traces of 
                            modern civilization was just a memory of what was – something surreal and mystical to the common person birthed in this era.

                            Civilization was being rebuilt. Global commerce, communication and intellectual exchanges was happening once again. Magic became more powerful. Tribes turned into monarchies. Monarchies turned to empires. 
                            There was a resurrection of what was lost in the air. It was short lived though.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Earth itself seemed to conspire against the idea of globalism and civilization. Towers in the arctic sprung forth from the sea, pulsing with a pink static glow – instantly killing all who can hear the pulse. 
                           These spires soon sprung forth in the seas, right where trade winds were – effectively ending sea-trading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Toxic red liquid sprung from the ground running towards the coasts of the world. This liquid can kill any mortal that touches it. However, this red liquid dissolves once it 
                            reaches the ocean. It did not overflow. It did not dry up. It was always there. It carved up civilization more as it created a difficult geographic boundary to cross.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some areas constantly changed geographic features day to day. Interestingly, the monsters from the previous apocalypse all migrated to these lands and seem to adapt naturally 
                            to these features. Those that wandered in these lands rarely survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Civilization could not progress, more starved, more died and wars for resources continued, while the Avatars regrew their strength.

                            Over time, civilization swelled once more. The mortals that were able to survive and became resilient to the monsters that lurked about. Dynasties, clans and empires grew over time. Urban centers became a thing once more as populations 
                            exited the borders of the deadlands. Mutants, lycanthropes, elf and protohumans enjoyed their majority over humans, but it was short lived.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because the urban growth was unchecked, many lived in terrible conditions. Hygiene was a lost concept for the common folk. Soon terrible plagues emerged, wiping out 28% of civilization. 
                            These plagues were especially disastrous to the lycanthropes, threatening extinction to their kind. Humans remained non impacted by these plagues as these were plagues their ancestors had 
                            already faced and overcame.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soon, new governments emerged and Humans became the ones to be masters of the world once again. Yet no government or warlord dynasty lasted for more than two generations during this era. As empires collapsed, 
                            warlords waged wars of conquest for resources that ironically depleted food and materials for survival. Civilization was at its death throes at the peak during this crisis.

                        <p>
                            Those mortals that survived were nomadic clans that hunted other clans and whatever they could use to survive. It was a barbaric era that favored the violent, aggressive, sinister and strong.

                            After these calamities, it seemed Earth was trying to try to reject the many changes and blood being spilt on it. As such, terrible super events occurred throughout the world.                             
                        </p>

                                <li> In the Caribbean three Hurricanes formed that kept rotating from the coast of South America to the Florida Keys – wiping out all life in this area. </li>
                                <li> In the Pacific Rim, all volcanoes erupted covering the Earth in ashes for a week. These eruptions caused massive flooding in the remaining coastal populations on earth – killing many. </li>
                                <li> Europe suffered a thousand day blizzard, freezing and starving many. </li>
                                <li> Asia suffered flooding and earthquakes, burying and drowning many – submerging and breaking parts of the continent. </li>

                        <p>
                            Civilization changed once again, and rebuilt. With the amount of devastation occurred, many migrated from various areas, spreading knowledge and customs and dying along the way. A few legendary warlords emerged, but these were all temporary tribes, clans and feudal systems as they’d be wiped out by avatars, monsters or “freak” natural disasters.

                            With the deadlands and Earthly diasters, what remained of mortal civilization was loose memories of what. Little farming villages existed with scattered mortals clinging onto a gatherer-hunter lifestyle. 
                            Avatars, and their new race the Arisen, ruled the land with an iron-fist in Avatar nation states. These nation states warred among eachother, collecting and trading slaves with other Avatars. Things seemed bleak for mortals. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Without warning or prophecies, portals were torn open from what could be desribed as heaven and hell. Earth became a host as the war between hell and heaven spilled into reality. Angelic and
                            demonic hosts reached out to the mortals, blessing those that joined their forces with powers. Epic battles waged among North America, leaving devisation and ruins in the aftermath. 
                            It became clear that both the angels and demons had no intention to save the world - but to just use it as a battleground. Mortals betrayed their angel and demon masters and went into hiding.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the same time, the Avatars did not did not appreciate these beings interfering with their claim to the world. It caused the Avatars to do something they haven't done before, unite together. 
                            The united avatar-nations made their way into the Midwest United States and a gruesome and brutal battle between Angels, Demons, and Avatars waged for years. Mortals struggled to survive and not be involved, 
                            but few pledged their allegiances as a means of survival. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The war waged on Earth for a generation and had a profound impact. The invasion ended abruptly as it begain. With a demon lord being slain and an angel warlord mortally wounded, the celestial forces vanished
                            - never to be heard from again. Many of the Avatars were slain and devistated by these celestial beings, effectively freeing Mortals from their rule once more. Additionally, 
                            the powers bestowed upon the mortals caused warlords to turn their clans into the six empires we see today.
