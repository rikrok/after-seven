        <p> 
            Your character once served a mighty empire. Perhaps they were a merchant, mechanic, spy, infantry 
            or a minor officer. They were loyal, idealist and na√Øve. Your character served your empire well. They carried out 
            and executed orders that are morally questionable at a daily rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be it through betrayl, loss, fate or awakening your character is now an outlaw. They are labeled as traitors and 
            unwelcomed in every civilized place in North America.
