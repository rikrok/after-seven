                    This setting requires a bit more specialization than previously required, we altered what it means to have Arcana, Divine and Primal magic.

                        There is an invisible but tangible natural force that swims around in the space-between-space 
                        that individuals can tap into.

                        It is best described as a flickering flame on a candle. It 
                        helps you see what’s not there. It casts dancing shadows. It can destroy by dancing off the 
                        candle, catching parchment on fire. Yet – one needs it if they are to learn and understand.

                        Anything is possible with Arcana magic. It is the practice of interacting with the mysterious 
                        and wondrous magical winding streams of Arcana energy.

                    <p>
                        Divine magic is rather superstitious and least understood branches of magic in the world. Divine 
                        magic is not learned through books. It is experienced and earned, as they say. However, some would 
                        say it is luck and chance. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divine magic roots from supernatural beings who are ultra-powerful named Avatars. These creatures 
                        entrust slivers of power to worthy beings who worship or serve them. They are not Gods, but it is 
                        very easy to mistake them as such. They do not communicate with mortals often. When an Avatar does, 
                        it is in form of riddles and cryptic messages that are widely open to many interpretations. 
                        No same mortal will exactly hear the same message from an Avatar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divine casters pray, meditate and focus solely on their service to an avatar. Prior to casting a 
                        spell, divine spell casters reach out to their Avatars. Should the Avatar answer their prayer, it 
                        will be in terms of a successful casting of that spell. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is unpredictable as to forecast a spell casting being successful. When a spell caster has enough successes casting a spell, it turns into a tradition. After repeated celebrations and traditions of 
                        this particular set of spells, it leads to cults having strange and vibrant superstitions for each cult. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divine magic spell casters cannot tap into Arcana or Primal sources, they must abandon their beliefs 
                        and practices of the other schools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divine magic is different yet similar to Arcana magic. It has a more synthetic feeling to the spell 
                        than a Primal spell. Yet, it has a more mysterious and organic feel than an Arcana spell.

                    <p> 
                        There is the natural world which everything is tangible and is considered real. Then there is the 
                        nebulous and not well understood spirit world. This is where ghosts, elements, souls and spirits 
                        of objects walk. Primal magic is about the link between the natural world and the spirit world. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Primal spell casters are able to understand, interject their will, and intercept the linkage between 
                        the natural world and spirit world. These spell casters can speak to elementals, see spirits and 
                        commune with those who already permanently wonder the afterlife. This in turn can give them a wide 
                        range of capabilities. They can convince air elementals to appear as a tornado, they can talk to 
                        trees, they can create terrible plagues or restore health to living creatures. The strongest casters 
                        have great control over life and death. Let is not be understood though, that Primal magic may see 
                        a soul, it can not outright own it or control it.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Primal magic can only be used if a mortal was born with the ability. It cannot be taught. Those that 
                        do have Primal magic are not accepted by those who would grant Divine magic. In addition, the Arcana 
                        stream proves too difficult to control, making them not able to cast Arcana spells.
