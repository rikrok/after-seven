        <h1> <strong> About </strong> </h1>
        <p> 
            This is a genre that I call <strong>Magepunk</strong>. It is a blend of low-tech, mixed with wizardry set in a post-apocalyptical North America. The setting is about the evolution 
            (or devolution) of governmentâ€™s role, losing all meaning of the words "freedom, personal liberties, and education" mixed with the horrors that lurk out in the wild. The setting 
            focuses on the role of government and uses monsters and fantasy aspects to explain why those that rule do so easily and awfully.

            Your character will be a protangonist that will face "the man" in epic battles, freeing people and establishing a legacy of liberty in a land of oppression.

                        The sciences of the modern world has been lost, recovered and lost again. Technology barely functions or is progressed. This is due to the act of Alchemy. 
                        In this setting, Alchemy is the act of binding magical forces in an industrial application. Powerful airships can be powered by blood magic. Terrible artillery machines rain
                        destruction down upon battlefields through the use of spells and over-complicated series of springs and gears. There is little motivation to explore science.

                        Magic is a mystical thing in this world. Arcana is the most sterotypical kind of magic that follows suit to most ideas about fantasy magic. Divine magic comes from monsters known as 
                        avatars. Primal magic is the link between the spirit world and the mortal world, it is believed to be the mechanicism of the universe.

                        Monsters are real and want to kill your character. Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, Gnolls and the usual cast of fantasy monsters exist. They are not organized into governments or 
                        anything comparable as to culture or society. They are not numerous, but they are terrifying and real enough.

                        Six governments battle to control resources. Each government has deep layers of conspiracies and plots that entangle any hope for peace or prosperity. Your character might be have been 
                        envolved with such a plot, knowingly or unknowningly.

                        Altruism is foreign and strange in these lands. Mercy is alienates people. Forgiveness is a trait that is seen as offensive and taboo. Heroism has been successfully demonized by institutionalized 
                        propaganda.

                        Industry is at a low point. There are factories that spit out machines and products, but at the cost of souls and blood. These are known as soul factories.

                        This is a very different North America, where Canada, Mexico and the United States no longer exist. Chunks of land is submerged, such as New York to Toronto. Most of Mexico is overran by the Undead.
