                Alchemy is not a lost art in this setting. It is worked in as a pseudo-manufacturing 
                process that is magic based. It is mad science at its best and lethal at average. 
                It is mostly used as a narrative device to quest for and secure resources. 
                It is the driver of military conflicts, conspiracies and the economy.      
            </p> </b-col> </b-row>
            
            <b-row><b-col><p>
                Alchemy is the process of working with magical substance, namely Arcanite, to further create wonderous substances. Magical glues, 
                dense yet light rubbers, explosivly efficent fuels, and countless other wonders are made through psuedo-science. Beakers, tubings,
                and forges are heavily used in the process.

                This is largely open ended and not meant to be managed intensely. There will be no tables that dictate number of X equals to Y hours of electricity! 
                This is just flavor and fluff, and not meant to be a substitute for a resource management game.

            <h4> <strong> Rules </strong> </h4>
            
            <b-row><b-col><p>
                Given the above table (Component Table), if the character has enough Arcanite, they can attempt to create a product. 
                However, Alchemy is a difficult thing to practice. It requires the right tools, environment and experience. </br>
                The following are the mechanical rules when using alchemy. 
                <ul>
                    <li> An alchemist does not need to know spellcasting or be able to produce Arcanite. </li>
                    <li> Creating a product costs <strong>2 strain.</strong></li>
                    <li> Creating alchemy substances requires at least one hour of work. </li>
                    <li> Alchemy starts with <strong>2 setback dice </strong> to the dice pool. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Bloodoil Tonic</strong> spends threats, advantages, dispairs and triumphs differently. </li>
                </ul>
            </p> </b-col> </b-row>
            
            <h4> <strong> Arcanite </strong> </h4>
            <b-row><b-col><p>
                Alchemy is based on harvesting the energies of magic, which is in a substance called Arcanite. </br>
                It usually comes in small quantities of bright neon green liquid. Spell casters can generate <strong>1 Arcanite per 1 hour</strong> 
                spent isolated and concentrating on this task.
                Arcanite can be further refined to turn into magical substances through Alchemy.
            </p> </b-col> </b-row>
            
            <h4> <strong> Components </strong> </h4>
            <b-row><b-col><p>
                In order to produce results through Alchemy, you simply need quantity of “Arcanite”. For example, for Manarok, 
                you’d need 120 Arcanite to try to make one Manarok crystal. </br>
                This means a typical spell caster needs to <strong> focus 120 hours </strong> to produce enough Arcanite for such a task. You’d better off just buying some or stealing some!  
            </p> </b-col> </b-row>

                Here's a small chart to guide you on how to make components to sell, trade or whatever creative uses you
                may come up with.
