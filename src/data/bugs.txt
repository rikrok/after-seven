functions add:
    import races json
    import items json
    import skills json
    import talents json
        make them career givers
        
bug repot:
    burly seems to be withdrawing twice.
    talent names become less than one talent once removed. 
    cyber is not reducing strain.
    Amplimotive Armor is not drawing a bonus. 
    riot armor is not adding the bonus riot shield.
    recieve error in custom mode when using AS careers, due to bonuses. 
    character name seems to be broken.

misc notes that aren't bugs just things:
    some items kind of strange genres, maybe fix, maybe not.
    mozilla is slow as shit.
